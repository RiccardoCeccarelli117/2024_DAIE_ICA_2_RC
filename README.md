Riccardo Ceccarelli D00276951 DAIE ICA2 - Interactive RDBMS data with Quarto & Shiny

There are two quarto notebooks, named: part_a&b&d_quarto.qmd; part_c_shiny.qmd

The first quarto document is rendered and you will find a HTML file with the same name, however part_c_quarto is not rendering despite being functional, there is a HTML file but Shiny is not working properly
(unless launched manually with the chunk in lines 142 - 144)

SQL database is in /data
